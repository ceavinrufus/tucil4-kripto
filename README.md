# TransCrypt: RSA-Encrypted Chat Platform

ChatRSA provides a secure chat environment where messages are encrypted using the robust RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm. RSA ensures confidentiality by allowing users to exchange messages that are unreadable by anyone who doesn't possess the recipient's private key.

## How to run in local development server:

1. Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

2. API server

(You need to create a MongoDB database and store the connection link in the `.env` file located on `backend` folder)

```
cd backend
echo MONGO_URL="mongo connection string" > .env & attrib +s .env
node index.js
```

3. Chat server (socket)

```
cd chat
echo NODE_ENV="development" > .env & attrib +s .env
node index.js
```
